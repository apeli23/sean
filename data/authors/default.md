Welcome to my blog about software development, blockchain, entrepreneurship, investment and new technologies.

My name is Denis Sean and, I work as a Software Contractor in Nairobi Kenya.

Since I was very young I have been passionate about new technologies. As freelance developer, entrepreneur and as software contractor, I have 1 year of experience from Zohari Tech Systems Nairobi.

In addition to software development, I am passionate about the world of entrepreneurship, investment, doctrine and blockchain.
